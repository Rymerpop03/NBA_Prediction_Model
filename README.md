# NBA_Prediction_Model
This machine learning project predicts outcomes of NBA games using team and performance-based statistics. This project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques. It predicts which team is more likely to win given key efficiency and shooting metrics. 

# Overview
The NBA_Prediction_Model uses historical NBA data to estimate gmae outcomes. Built in python, this model uses a Random Forest Classifier to identify the most important features that influence game results.
